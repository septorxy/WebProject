        At Ta Randi Restaurant, we strive to offer our customers both a contemporary and traditional dining experience. We ensure that dining at our restaurant will be an unforgettable experience with great food which is prepared with skill and served with a smile. 
        <br><br>
        Our history is as interesting as our dishes are appetizing. We only started off as a small establishment operating from a few rooms. These rooms were actually used as a resting place for locals coming from the south of our lovely little island. 
        During WW2 our restaurant also served as a shelter. To this day, there still exists an entry to an underground shelter which ultimately connects to the Mellieha Parish Church, however this has since been barred. 
        <br><br>
        Ta Randi was inaugurated as a restaurant in 1987, and through all the years we are still here, proud and happy to be serving you. We always ensure that our service and impeccable dishes will make your visit a memorable one and we hope to you over and over.
